# Motorsports Data Analysis and Visualization

## Overview

This Python-based project focuses on data analysis and visualization in the motorsports domain. The tool allows users to explore and gain insights from various aspects of motorsports races, including lap times, driver statistics, and race results.

## Features

- **Data Collection:** Collects race data, lap times, driver statistics, and race results from motorsports series.

- **Data Processing:** Cleans and preprocesses the collected data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.

- **Analysis:** Calculates statistics and metrics, compares driver performance, and analyzes the impact of external factors on race outcomes.

- **Visualization:** Utilizes Matplotlib and other libraries to create interactive and informative visualizations, including line charts, bar charts, and heatmaps.

- **User Interface (Optional):** Provides a simple user interface for users to select specific races, drivers, or seasons for analysis.

- **Machine Learning (Optional):** Incorporates machine learning models to predict race outcomes or identify patterns in driver performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Install required packages: `pip install pandas matplotlib`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
